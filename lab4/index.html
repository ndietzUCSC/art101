						<h2>Pseudocode for self administered injection</h3>
						<h4>Preparation</h4>
							<ol>
								<li>Walk to sink; stand comfortably.</li>
								<li>Place both hands under faucet opening.</li>
								<li>Using right hand thumb and fingers, turn faucet handle clockwise to start water.</li>
								<li>Adjust handle until steady, moderate water flow.</li>
								<li>Slowly move both hands back and forth under water, fingers downward, to wet all surfaces.</li>
								<li>Remove hands; with right hand thumb and forefinger, grasp soap dispenser pump.</li>
								<li>Press down pump once firmly; release.</li>
								<li>Rub palms together, fingers interlaced; cover all surfaces.</li>
								<li>Place right palm over left back of hand; rub in circular motion; switch hands.</li>
								<li>Interlace fingers, rub palm to palm.</li>
								<li>Rub backs of fingers against opposing palms with fingers interlocked.</li>
								<li>Rotate thumbs in clasping motions.</li>
								<li>Rub fingertips in circular motions on opposite palms.</li>
								<li>Rinse both hands thoroughly under running water.</li>
								<li>Using right elbow, turn off faucet by twisting handle clockwise.</li>
								<li>Dry hands with disposable towel, patting and rubbing all surfaces.</li>
								<li>Use towel to open medication vial packaging; discard towel.</li>
								<li>Inspect vial visually; with dominant hand, grasp vial firmly by base.</li>
							</ol>
						<h4>Sterilizing</h4>
							<ol>
								<li>Using thumb and index of non-dominant hand, tear open alcohol swab packet.</li>
								<li>Remove swab; hold between thumb and index of dominant hand.</li>
								<li>Press swab tip onto vial stopper; wipe in slow clockwise circular motion three times.</li>
								<li>Remove swab carefully; do not re-touch stopper.</li>
							</ol>
						<h4>Drawing Medication</h4>
							<ol>
								<li>Remove syringe from package using dominant hand fingers; avoid touching needle.</li>
								<li>Pull needle cap off by grasping it between thumb and index, pulling straight.</li>
								<li>Insert needle through vial stopper perpendicular with dominant hand.</li>
								<li>Invert vial and syringe together; pull plunger back with thumb and fingers slowly to fill syringe with prescribed volume.</li>
								<li>Tap syringe gently with fingers to release air bubbles.</li>
								<li>Push plunger slowly to expel air and excess medication to prescribed dose.</li>
							</ol>
						<h4>Needle Change</h4>
							<ol>
								<li>Recap needle by carefully placing needle tip into cap without touching outside.</li>
								<li>Pull syringe needle and cap off vial without twisting.</li>
								<li>With thumb and index finger, remove original needle by holding syringe barrel securely and pulling needle straight.</li>
								<li>Take new needle; press onto syringe tip firmly until secure.</li>
							</ol>
						<h4>Injection</h4>
							<ol>
								<li>Select injection site; clean with new alcohol swab using circular motion for 15 seconds; allow to air dry.</li>
								<li>Hold syringe like a pencil between thumb and fingers.</li>
								<li>Stretch skin of injection site taut with non-dominant hand.</li>
								<li>Insert needle into skin quickly at prescribed angle.</li>
								<li>With thumb, depress plunger steadily to inject medication slowly.</li>
								<li>Withdraw needle swiftly at same angle.</li>
								<li>Immediately apply gentle pressure with clean gauze or cotton ball.</li>
							</ol>
						<h4>Cleanup</h4>
							<ol>
								<li>Engage safety mechanism on needle if available.</li>
								<li>Place syringe and needle immediately into sharps container.</li>
								<li>Discard all disposables (alcohol swabs, packaging) into biohazard waste.</li>
								<li>Wash hands again as in steps 2-15 to conclude."</li>

								<h2>Memory, Card Matching Game</h2>
								<blockquote>Still generated by GPT 4.1, but with less detail, to emulate the detail level of code comments.</blockquote>
								<ol>
									<li>Shuffle the cards thoroughly to randomize their order.</li>
									<li>Lay all cards face down on the table.</li>
									<li>Player flips two cards per turn.</li>
									<li>If they match, keep the pair.</li>
									<li>Check if the flipped cards match.</li>
									<li>Player takes another turn after a match.</li>
									<li>If they do not match, flip the cards back.</li>
									<li>Pass the turn to the next player.</li>
									<li>Continue until all pairs are matched.</li>
									<li>Count each player’s pairs.</li>
									<li>Determine the player with the most pairs as the winner.</li>
									<li>Display “Congratulations! You matched all the pairs!”.</li>
